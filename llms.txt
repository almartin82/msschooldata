Fetch and analyze Mississippi school enrollment data from the
Mississippi Department of Education (MDE) in R or Python.

## What can you find with msschooldata?

**18 years of enrollment data (2007-2024).** 440,000 students. 144
districts. Here are ten stories hiding in the numbers - see the
**[Enrollment Trends
vignette](https://almartin82.github.io/msschooldata/articles/enrollment-trends.html)**
for interactive visualizations.

1.  **Mississippi is majority Black in many districts** - Unlike most
    Southern states, Mississippi has numerous majority-Black school
    districts, especially in the Delta region.

2.  **The Delta is emptying out** - Districts in the Mississippi Delta
    (Coahoma, Bolivar, Sunflower, Leflore) have lost 30-50% of students
    since 2007.

3.  **DeSoto County: Mississippi’s growth engine** - Bordering Memphis,
    DeSoto County has nearly doubled enrollment to become the state’s
    second-largest district.

4.  **Jackson Public Schools’ steep decline** - Mississippi’s capital
    city has lost over 40% of students, from 32,000 to under 20,000.

5.  **Economic disadvantage is nearly universal** - Over 75% of
    Mississippi students are economically disadvantaged - the highest
    rate in the nation.

6.  **COVID hit kindergarten hard** - Mississippi lost 7% of
    kindergartners in 2021 and enrollment hasn’t recovered.

7.  **Madison County: A suburban success** - Madison County (north of
    Jackson) has grown while Jackson itself shrinks - classic suburban
    flight.

8.  **Hispanic population is growing** - From 2% to over 4% statewide,
    with some districts like Forest Municipal reaching 20%+.

9.  **The Coast is holding steady** - Gulf Coast districts (Harrison,
    Jackson County, Hancock) have maintained enrollment despite
    hurricanes.

10. **Charter schools are minimal** - Mississippi has one of the
    smallest charter sectors - under 5,000 students in the entire state.

## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("almartin82/msschooldata")
```

## Quick start

### R

``` r
library(msschooldata)
library(dplyr)

# Fetch one year
enr_2024 <- fetch_enr(2024)

# Fetch multiple years
enr_multi <- fetch_enr_multi(2020:2024)

# State totals
enr_2024 %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL")

# Largest districts
enr_2024 %>%
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  arrange(desc(n_students)) %>%
  head(15)

# Jackson demographics
enr_2024 %>%
  filter(grepl("Jackson Public", district_name), grade_level == "TOTAL",
         subgroup %in% c("white", "black", "hispanic", "asian")) %>%
  select(subgroup, n_students, pct)
```

### Python

``` python
import pymsschooldata as ms

# Check available years
years = ms.get_available_years()
print(f"Data available from {years['min_year']} to {years['max_year']}")

# Fetch one year
enr_2024 = ms.fetch_enr(2024)

# Fetch multiple years
enr_multi = ms.fetch_enr_multi([2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024])

# State totals
state_total = enr_2024[
    (enr_2024['is_state'] == True) &
    (enr_2024['subgroup'] == 'total_enrollment') &
    (enr_2024['grade_level'] == 'TOTAL')
]

# Largest districts
districts = enr_2024[
    (enr_2024['is_district'] == True) &
    (enr_2024['subgroup'] == 'total_enrollment') &
    (enr_2024['grade_level'] == 'TOTAL')
].sort_values('n_students', ascending=False).head(15)

# Jackson demographics
jackson = enr_2024[
    (enr_2024['district_name'].str.contains('Jackson Public', na=False)) &
    (enr_2024['grade_level'] == 'TOTAL') &
    (enr_2024['subgroup'].isin(['white', 'black', 'hispanic', 'asian']))
][['subgroup', 'n_students', 'pct']]
```
